# Blockscanner

BlockScanner is a blockchain explorer app developed as part of my assessment for Alchemy University. It is heavily influenced by etherscan and [AlSirang](https://github.com/AlSirang)'s take on blockchain explorer [Blockchain Explorer](https://github.com/AlSirang/blockchain-explorer).

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Installation 

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/alkautsarf/eth-block-explorer.git
   ````
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```shell
    cd eth-block-explorer
    ```
3. Install all dependencies:

    ```shell
    npm i
    ```

### Run App in Local

1. Start the development server:

    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the app in development mode and automatically open it in your default browser. The app will reload automatically whenever you make changes to the source code.

2. Access the app

    Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the BlockScanner app.

### Features

- View detailed information about blocks, transactions, and addresses on the blockchain.
- Pagination support for browsing through large amounts of data.
- Search functionality to find specific blocks, transactions, or addresses.
- Retro design for fellow cypherpunk 

### Honorable Mentions

I would like to express my gratitude to [AlSirang](https://github.com/AlSirang) for generously permitting me to use his code as a reference and make a few adjustments to it. Thank you!
